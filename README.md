# VexMath
Math library for PROS projects focused on speed. Currently implements: 
* various fast/vectorized pseudo-random number generators
* vectorized versions of common math functions (trig, square root, etc.)
* fast normally-distributed prng generator (modified float-based [implementation of ziggurat algorithm](https://github.com/cd-mcfarland/fast_prng))
* simple Entropy class to generate random numbers heavily based on [veranda](https://github.com/Gavin-Niederman/veranda)
